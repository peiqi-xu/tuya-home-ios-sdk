2. Import security image to the project and rename as `t_s.bmp`, then add it into `Project Setting => Target => Build Phases => Copy Bundle Resources`.
3. Add the following to the project file `PrefixHeader.pch`：

```objective-c
#import <TuyaSmartHomeKit/TuyaSmartKit.h>
```

Open file `AppDelegate.m`，and use the `App ID` and `App Secret` obtained from the development platform in the `[AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]`method to initialize SDK:

```objective-c
[[TuyaSmartSDK sharedInstance] startWithAppKey:<#your_app_key#> secretKey:<#your_secret_key#>];
